Count draft picks to debug the duplication issue

# Let's approach this differently - let's see what's actually in the database
# by adding some debug logic to understand the multiplication

# The issue: SveetVilliam should have ~4 picks total, but 776,960 value suggests ~78 picks
# This means there's a 20x multiplication happening somewhere

print("1. Draft picks being inserted multiple times (per year, per team, etc.)")

print("3. Draft positions table has duplicate entries")

print("2. Check draft_positions table - how many records per team?") 
print("3. Check if SQL joins are still multiplying results")
print("4. Add DISTINCT to prevent duplicates in SQL")
